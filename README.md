# 🥳 SplitSmart - Expense Splitter for Close Friends

SplitSmart is a fun and modern mobile + web app that helps small friend groups easily split expenses after hanging out, partying, or going out together. Whether you're sharing food, drinks, rides, or any service — SplitSmart makes it simple to **split equally** or **assign exact costs per person**.

Inspired by a real problem after a party where it was hard to track who paid what, SplitSmart helps friends stay organized and stress-free when it comes to shared money.
